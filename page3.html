<b><i><p style = "font-size: 25px; color: #ffbb00"> It is important to know what is involved in looking after butterflies before you begin.</p></i></b>

   <br><p id="ptwo">The life cycle of a butterfly can be seen as very simple compared with other forms of wildlife. For a butterfly, life starts with the caterpillar, continuing with the pupa stage and ending with the last stage – the actual butterfly.</p></br>

  <br><p id="ptwo"> After mating, the female will then find suitable spots to lay her eggs. The usual place that she will do this is on a leaf, as after the eggs hatch, the caterpillar will find its food source immediately. If you don’t provide leaves for her however, she will leave them anywhere within the lore. Once laid, it is important that the eggs are left for three to eight hours in order to dry out. Afterwards, you can use a brush and move the eggs into a ventilated box with tissue paper on the bottom. Be aware this environment is vulnerable for mould and other spores, so create some form of ventilation to dry the inside of the box.</p></br>

  <br><p class = "htextp3"> TAKING CARE OF NEW-BORN CATERPILLARS</p></br>
  <br><p id="ptwo"> After hatching, the caterpillars are small and fragile, so moving or even touching them can be fatal. Try to use the leaf underneath and take them out of the hatching box and place them where you want raise them. It is important to keep different caterpillars of different ages in different places. </p></br>

  <br><p class = "htextp3">FEEDING YOUR CATERPILLARS </p></br>
  <br> <img src= "media2/feed.jpeg" alt="Feeding" width=30%></br>
 <br><p id="ptwo"> Fresh plants are crucial for the growth and health of all caterpillars due to the fact that they eat so much, so it is recommended that you offer different species of plant to ensure a diverse menu. Remember to replace them from time to time, because caterpillars need fresh leaves. They can also be placed within a container of shallow water to increase the longevity of the leaves.</p></br>

   <br><p class = "htextp3">CLEANING THEIR ENVIRONMENT</p></br>
 
 <p id="ptwo"> Clean the box every day, because caterpillars produce a lot of droppings and this, combined with moisture, could produce spores and mould.That’s why it’s important to use paper tissues that can be replaced with fresh ones. Replace old leaves with new ones and throw the stalks of the leaves away.</p>

<br><p class = "htextp3">GETTING THE PUPAE OUT</p></br>
<br> <img src= "media2/pupae.jpeg" alt="Pupae" width=40%></br>
<br><p id="ptwo"> Once that the caterpillar is in its final stage of development, it will find a suitable place for pupating. Before making its cocoon, the caterpillar will search for the right place and will look for the perfect spot. If you recognise this behaviour, make sure you have enough space available for all caterpillars to pupate. If you need extra room, carefully remove the cocoon and place it to another enclosure without any caterpillars.</p></br>

<br> <img src= "media2/butterfly.jpeg" alt="Butterfly" width=30%></br>
<br><p id="ptwo"> Finally you made it! Now you can decide to release the butterflies into a natural environment when the weather is favorable!</p></br>
